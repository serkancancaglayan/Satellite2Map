# Satellite2Map
 Transforming Satellite images to Map  using Pix2Pix GAN

# Project Overview

The Satellite-to-Map GAN project showcases the power of deep learning in transforming satellite images into realistic map-like representations. This repository contains an implementation of a Pix2Pix GAN using the PyTorch framework. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how GANs can be used to generate high-quality images.

Pix2Pix is a GAN architecture that's designed for image-to-image translation tasks. It was introduced by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, in their 2016 paper titled "Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks."
