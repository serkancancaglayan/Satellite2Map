# Satellite2Map
 Transforming Satellite images to Map  using Pix2Pix GAN

# Project Overview

The Satellite-to-Map GAN project showcases the power of deep learning in transforming satellite images into realistic map-like representations. This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the PyTorch framework. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how GANs can be used to generate high-quality images that bridge the gap between satellite data and map data.
